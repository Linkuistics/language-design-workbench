# Language Design Workbench (LDW)

## Overview

The Language Design Workbench (LDW) is a powerful tool for working with language
grammars and generating tooling and documentation for them. It allows you to
define grammars using a specific syntax and generates various TypeScript modules
to support language processing, parsing, formatting, and testing.

There is further documentation in the [docs/Overview.md](docs/Overview.md) file,
which describes the system in more detail, and in particular is used as an input
to AI prompts.

This project is largely generated by AI, and forms a testbed for using AI for
coding, especially in the field of programming language design and
implementation.

## [ Installation ](./Installation.md)

## Usage

### Building the Project

To compile the TypeScript files, run:

```
npm run build
```

### Using the MSBNF CLI

To parse MSBNF grammars, use the following command:

```
npm run msbnf parse -- [options]
```

Options:

-   `-i, --input <file>`: Input file (default: stdin)
-   `-o, --output <file>`: Output file (default: stdout)

## Tutorial

A [tutorial](docs/tutorial/parser/README.md) on building parsers using the custom parser
infrastructure is available. Please note that this tutorial was created by AI
using the simplest possible instruction and has not been touched by a human. It
is known to be very much a first pass that is neither focused on what we want,
nor guaranteed to be correct. Use it as a starting point for understanding the
system, but be aware that it may contain inaccuracies or may not fully align
with the project's current state or goals.

# Building Parsers with Custom Parser Infrastructure

Welcome to this comprehensive, hands-on tutorial on building parsers using a custom parser infrastructure. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating efficient and flexible parsers for various language grammars, with a focus on backtracking and ordered choice alternatives. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the skills to build powerful parsers for a wide range of applications.

## Introduction to Parser Infrastructure

Our custom parser infrastructure provides a flexible foundation for building parsers. It includes several core components:

- `inputStream`: Handles input processing and tracking
- `stringInputStream`: A specialized input stream for string-based parsing
- `parser`: The main parsing engine that supports backtracking and ordered choice alternatives
- `parseError`: Handles error reporting and recovery

This infrastructure allows you to create robust, maintainable, and efficient parsers for a wide range of languages and data formats. The parsers built with this infrastructure use backtracking and ordered choice alternatives, enabling powerful and flexible parsing capabilities.

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into several sections, each building upon the previous ones:

1. [Core Components](core-components.md): An in-depth look at the `inputStream`, `stringInputStream`, `parser`, and `parseError` classes. You'll learn about the fundamental building blocks of our parser infrastructure and how they interact.

2. [Building Parsers](building-parsers.md): Learn how to use the core components to construct parsers. This section includes a step-by-step guide to creating your first parser, with practical examples and explanations of key concepts.

3. [Backtracking and Alternatives](backtracking-and-alternatives.md): Understand the backtracking nature of the parsers and how to work with ordered choice alternatives. You'll explore how these features allow you to handle complex and ambiguous grammars effectively.

4. [Advanced Techniques](advanced-techniques.md): Explore more complex parsing scenarios and optimizations. This section covers topics such as error recovery, custom input streams, context-sensitive parsing, and performance optimization techniques.

Each section includes practical examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding and give you hands-on experience with the concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with building parsers using our infrastructure, you'll need to set up your project environment. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the repository containing the parser infrastructure:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/parser-infrastructure.git
   cd parser-infrastructure
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure:
   - `src/`: Contains the core parser infrastructure
   - `tutorial/`: Contains this tutorial and example parsers

Now that you have the project set up, you're ready to dive into understanding the core components and creating your first parser!

We recommend going through the tutorial sections in order, as each builds upon the knowledge from the previous ones. Start your journey by exploring the core components in the [Core Components](core-components.md) section.

As you progress through the tutorial, you'll build increasingly sophisticated parsers, culminating in the advanced techniques that will allow you to tackle complex parsing challenges in real-world scenarios.

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. We encourage you to experiment with the code examples, modify them, and try building your own parsers as you work through the tutorial.

Happy parsing, and enjoy your journey into the world of custom parser development!
